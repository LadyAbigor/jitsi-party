CREATE A PARTY:

Leader selects x users from UI (x defined in config)
Send POST request to server (invitation, usernames/userids)
    Alternatively, use websockets?
Server sends socket update to each user_id in list 
On websocket event, each client shows popup: <x has invited you to follow them> or <x has invited you to join their party>
    If yes
        If already following, nothing happens: <sorry, you cannot follow more than one leader at a time>
        else
            update react state with leader=leader_id
            on each user-event, find where leader_id is and go there (update state)
    If no
        nothing happens

FOLLOW A LEADER:

Select one leader from the UI
Socket update to server --> socket update to leader: <x wants to follow you around>
    If deny
        Socket update to server --> socket update to follower: <x has denied your request to follow them>
    If accept
        Socket update to server --> socket update to follower: <x has accepted your request to follow them>
        update react state with leader=leader_id
        on each user-event, find where leader_id is and go there 


CREATING AD HOC ROOMS:

Same as "Creating a party" except when match is made, spins up a new special purpose room without any navigation buttons
Can still navigation away using map
If map is hidden can use button to "go back" to party (last room you were in or vestibule)


Leaving the party (leaving the leader/follower relationship)
- Should this be an explicit button? Meaning we could disable navigation buttons and just let leader "take over"
- Or should navigation buttons be enabled?

TST version:

Additional notes:
- Ability to do this should be restricted, i.e. should only show up if you get a badge
- Party size should be configurable and restricted for our purposes
- Ad hoc room size should be restricted to 2 people for cabin parties to avoid cliques (configurable option)
- What happens if leader tries to go somewhere inaccessible? Like if room is at capacity
- What happens if leader tries to go somewhere that doesn't have video? ex art gallery
